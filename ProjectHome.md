# Aim #
This thunderbird add-on aims to provide a fully featured integration with various CRM systems.

The extension will provide:
  * An interface to add email to the CRM system
  * Contact Synchronisation - both from and to the CRM tool.
  * ~~Calendar Synchronisation (with Thunderbird 3.0)~~ Possibly
  * Configurability of field mappings for both email, and contacts.

# Status #
Under active development. An beta trial is now available for anyone brave enough, no warranty implied etc.

The most recent (possibly unstable) version is available at http://thunderbirdgriffin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/griffin.xpi. Developer tested versions are available from the downloads section.

**We're now on the thunderbird add-on site!** Please add a review if you have the time to help us get out of the sandbox there.
